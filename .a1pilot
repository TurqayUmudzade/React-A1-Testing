 This project seems to be a frontend web application built with Vite.js and Tailwind CSS.

The src folder likely contains all the source code for the frontend. This includes components, pages, styles, etc.

The server folder probably contains the backend code for an API.

The public folder holds static assets like images.

package.json contains metadata about the project and its dependencies.

.gitignore tells Git which files to ignore.

.eslintrc contains ESLint configuration, for code style checking.

index.html is likely the entry point HTML file.

Overall, this seems to be a frontend web app with a separate backend API, built with modern tools like Vite, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint.
